## Introduction

Welcome to the Vocab Victor Partner Zone! Empower your language learning applications with our innovative learner model. 
> A learner model is a description of the studentâ€™s knowledge and, in the context of intelligent tutoring, its main goal is to guide pedagogical decision-making. -Trude Heift 

By integrating our technology, your learners will benefit from adaptive and personalized learning experiences, significantly enhancing their engagement and outcomes.

## How it works

### Log your learners' activity

Use our API to log all vocabulary interactions. (Our excellent documentation and concierge-level customer support will get you set up!)

### Customize your activity types

Different language learning apps target different types of language learning, from passive reading to free production. We define each of these learnings as an *activity type*, which is associated with an observation.

Some example activity types: 
- Learner picks the correct L1 translation for a target word
- Learner uses the word in a sentence
- Learner produces the word in a puzzle game

Each learner observation is associated with a specific activity type.

### Our analytics engine takes over

Vocab Victor Zone's analytics engine examines the learner's interactions with words and creates a predictive model of the learner's vocabulary knowledge. 

### Adaptive learning model

Our learner model adapts to each user's unique learning progress, dynamically adjusting to provide personalized recommendations. This continuous adaptation ensures that learners receive the most effective instruction tailored to their current needs.

### Personalized learning with zone words

Our vocabulary learner model pinpoints the *zone of proximal development* (ZPD) for each learner, offering the next, best words for every activity type in your app. These "zone words" are just beyond the learner's current vocabulary level, ensuring they learn new words in an engaging, yet challenging way.

Once the model is created, you can query to API for zone words that are appropriate for each learner's desired activity type.

### Privacy and Security

We offer both private and open (shared) learner models to accommodate your privacy preferences. Our system ensures that all learner data is handled with the utmost security and privacy. You can choose to keep your data isolated or allow it to be shared in an anonymized, aggregate format to both benefit from and improve the overall model.

## Why it's good

### Use an out-of-the box learner model

Designing and implementing a sophisticated learner model for your app is necessary - but difficult! We offer a learner model that is:

- Designed based on the latest research in language acquisition
- Implemented using a well-documented API's straightforward hooks
- Maintained by ... not your team!

### Enhanced user retention

Remember *Goldilocks and the Three Bears*? Our model gives you words at the sweet spot of "not too hard" and "not too easy." This balance keeps learners engaged and motivated, reducing the risk of dropout and improving overall retention.


### A unified learning journey

Vocab Victor stands out by allowing learners to connect multiple language learning apps to provide a unified learning journey for vocabulary.

Imagine a learner who uses three different apps, each with a different activity type. Because vocabulary learning is an incremental process, each activity adds to the learner's knowledge. For example, consider this sequence:

- A learner reads a passage, and notices a new word. They may guess at the word's meaning through context, or click on it to see the definition. Now the word is in their ZPD for further meaning exposure and engagement.
- Later, the learner engages with that same word in a matching activity, word game, or multiple choice test. With each such engagement, their knowledge for the word is reinforced and advanced. This pushes the word into the ZPD for more active engagement.
- Finally, an activity to elicit production is presented, giving the learner a framework to use the word in a sentence or conversation. (In vocabulary acquisition, passive knowledge precedes active knowledge.)

This example demonstrates why each activity type needs its own model and set of zone words.

Because Vocab Victor Zone lets learners follow their progress across different learning tools, Vocab Victor zone passes off vocabulary like a baton in a relay race. Each app has different strengths, letting the learner experience on a seamless learning journey!

### Comprehensive tracking and analytics

With detailed tracking and analytics, you can gain deep insights into each learner's progress. This data-driven approach allows educators and developers to understand learner behavior and make informed decisions to enhance the learning experience.

## Frequently asked questions

### What systems architecture does Vocab Victor Zone use?

Our system is built on Google Cloud services, which gives a scalable and resilient architecture, designed to handle high volumes of data and user interactions. The architecture ensures uptime and reliability, critical for any educational application.

### Is our data secure?

We prioritize data security, implementing stringent measures to protect user information. Our platform complies with all relevant data protection regulations, ensuring that your users' data is safe and secure. All data that you send us is anonymized, and an data *we* collect from users is not accessible to your or other partners.

### How do you generate your learner model?

The Vocab Victor Zone model uses a combination of statistics, measurement algorithms, machine learning, and computational linguistics to analyze the observations and generate a learner model. The API uses this model to predict the best words for each learner to engage with next, based on their learning patterns. The Vocab Victor team is continually iterating on the models to improve their accuracy and effectiveness for your users.

### Why vocabulary?

Vocabulary knowledge is integral to foreign language knowledge, and necessary to excell in all four language skills - reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Also, activities involving vocabulary are easier to encode computationally, compared to grammatical structures.
