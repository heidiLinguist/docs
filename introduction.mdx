In educational software, one key challenge is to determine what content to deliver to users.

This decision is critical, because if you try to teach the learner content that is too easy (because they already know it), they will grow bored. If you give the learner content that is too
difficult, they may get frustrated and give up.

## Enter the learner model

A _learner model_ is a representation of a learner's knowledge, skills, and learning preferences.

<Note>
  If you have a good understanding of what the user already knows, you'll have a
  good idea of what they should learn next!
</Note>
Vocab Victor Zone is a service for computer assisted language learning tools that
builds a personalized vocabulary learner model for each of your users. This model
tracks each interaction your users have with each word, and uses cohort averages
to estimate knowledge for words the user hasn't seen.

Learners will be able to connect all their language learning apps together using the Vocab Victor Zone learner model. This means that the learner can have a seamless learning journey across multiple applications, each teaching different types of language knowledge.

Integrating the Vocab Victor Zone API into your app will allow you to provide your users with a personalized learning experience, tailored to their individual needs. This will help you keep your users **engaged** and **motivated**, and will help them learn more effectively.

## How it works

Use our API to log your learners' activity. This saves their learning journey in our Google Cloud SQL database. Vocab Victor Zone uses analytics to build a model which is personalized for each user, based on their learning patterns. Use the model to find your learner's [_zone words_](/zone-words), which are the next, best words for each learner, which can inform content you deliver for each activity in your app.

## Setting up
