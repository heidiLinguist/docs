description: "Give your users a personalized learning experience!"

Vocab Victor Zone lets you hook a vocabulary learning model into your language learning app. Use our API to log your learners' activity. This saves their learning journey in our Google Cloud SQL database. Vocab Victor Zone uses analytics to build a model which is personalized for each user, based on their learning patterns. Use the model to find your learner's _zone words_, the next, best words for each learner, which can inform content you deliver for each activity in your app.
