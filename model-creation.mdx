"A learner model is a description of the studentâ€™s knowledge and, in the context of intelligent tutoring, its main goal is to guide pedagogical decision-making." <Tooltip tip = "link">(Heift, 2008)</Tooltip>

Once the model is created, you can use the API to query for zone words that are appropriate for your learner's desired activity type. (**Models are specific to a particular activity type!**)
