Once you have [logged observations](/log-observations), you can use the Vocab Victor Zone API (LINK) to create a predictive model for your learners.

"A learner model is a description of the student’s knowledge and, in the context of intelligent tutoring, its main goal is to guide pedagogical decision-making." <Tooltip tip = "Heift, T.

</Info>

Vocab Victor Zone's analytics engine examines the learner's interactions with words and creates a predictive model of the learner's vocabulary knowledge. Once the model is created, you can use the API to query for zone words that are appropriate for your learner's desired activity type. (**Models are specific to a particular activity type!**)
