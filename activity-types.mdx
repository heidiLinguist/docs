Vocab Victor Zone is based around the concept of _activity types_. These are the different types of activities that your app offers to learners. Activity examples are:

- Reading a passage
- Clicking on a word to see its definition
- Writing a sentence
- Taking a quiz
- Playing a word game

Each activity type has a set of tags which together provide a linguistic-informed taxonomy of the learner's interaction with a word across multiple dimensions of lexical knowledge. Because Vocab Victor Zone tracks these interactions across multiple dimensions, it can provide a nuanced understanding of the learner's vocabulary acquisition process.

Following is a breakdown of the activity type taxonomies. There is some complexity to these types, but never fear:

<Tip>
  _**The Vocab Victor team will help you define activity types for your app.**_
  We will even add new tags to our taxonomy if needed to properly capture the
  unique learning experience in your app.

## Modality

How was the word encountered or produced?

| Value | Passive | Active | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| text  | ![Read](images/text.png)  | ![Write](images/write.png)  | Use when activity involves reading or writing text  |
| speech  | <img src="images/say.png" alt="Speak" width="70%"/>  | <img src="images/listen.png" alt="Listen" width="70%"/>  | Use when activity involves the learner speaking or listening  |
| sign | <img src="images/see.png" alt="See" width="70%"/> | <img src="images/sign.png" alt="Sign" width="70%"/>| Use when activity interaction is a signed language |
