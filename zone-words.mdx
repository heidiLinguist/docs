Russian Educational Psychologist Lev Vygotsky asserted that learning is best facilitated in the _zone of proximal development_ (ZPD). This is the area between what a learner can do independently and what they can do with the help of a more knowledgeable other. (Vygotsky, L. S. (1978)) In the case of the vocabulary learner model, the "knowledgeable other" is your app!

<Tip>
  If you try to teach the learner words that are too easy (words they already
  know), the learner will grow bored. If you give them words that are too
  difficult, they may get frustrated and give up.

The Vocab Victor Zone API helps you identify the vocabulary ZPD for each learner, for each activity
type in your app. This is done by providing the next, best words for each learner,
for each activity type in your app. These words are called _zone words_.

## What are zone words?

Zone words are the words that are just beyond the learner's current vocabulary level. They are the words that the learner is ready to learn next. By providing zone words to your learners, you can help them grow their vocabulary in a way that is engaging and challenging, but not overwhelming. Zone words are different for each activity type, because vocabulary learning is an incremental process. For example, consider this sequence:

- A learner reads a passage, and notices a new word. They may guess at the word's meaning thru context, or click on it to see the definition. Now the word is in the ZPD for further meaning exposure and engagement.
- The learner engages with the word in a matching activity, word game, or multiple choice test. With each such engagement, their knowledge for the word is reinforced and advanced. This pushes the word into the ZPD for more active engagement.
- Finally, an activity eliciting production is presented, where the learner uses the word in a sentence or conversation. In vocabulary acquisition, passive knowledge precedes active knowledge. This is an example of why each activity type has its own model and set of zone words.

Pro tip: Learners will be able to connect multiple language learning apps together using the Vocab Victor Zone learner model. Therefore, the above sequence could happen across multiple applications, each with different strengths, letting the learner embark on a seamless learning journey!
